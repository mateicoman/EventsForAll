<p><strong>I am trying</strong> to figure it out<br> how to create a html page.</p>

<!-- I don't really need this hyperlink here, but if I added it already... -->
<p> The resurse I used while creating this page can be found <a href="http://10.2.236.246/aboutme/resourses.html">here</a>.</p>

<!-- It is really hard to do a webpage about any subject possible...-->
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong>  Well, HTML and CSS are not that hard though. It took me half a day to figure different stuff out, but it is quite interesting. I haven't managed to make it a HMTL yet, but I hope at some point I will, hopefully before the deadline. Why are the 101 labs getting harder and harder? I mean, I know that we are supposed to learn by ourselves in most of the situations in our life, but honestly I could've used more help.

<p> I don't know what else to add here, so instead i will just add a picture of me :D. </p>

<!-- Basically, without the tutorials, I wouldn't have been able to create this page, I didn't know any HTML before.-->
